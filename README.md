## Database Setup

### 1. Create Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
  Book_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  Title VARCHAR(100),
  Author VARCHAR(100),
  Genre VARCHAR(100),
  Published_Year INT,
  Price NUMERIC(10,2),
  Stock INT
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  Customer_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Email VARCHAR(100),
  Phone VARCHAR(20),
  City VARCHAR(100),
  Country VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  Order_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  Customer_ID INT REFERENCES customers(Customer_ID),
  Book_ID INT REFERENCES books(Book_ID),
  Order_Date DATE,
  Quantity INT,
  Total_Amount INT
);

-- Modify column type
ALTER TABLE orders
ALTER COLUMN Total_Amount TYPE NUMERIC (10,2);
```

---

### 2. Import Data (Using `COPY`)

```sql
-- Books
COPY books(Book_ID, Title, Author, Genre, Published_Year, Price, Stock)
FROM 'E:\my SQL\ST - SQL ALL PRACTICE FILES\All Excel Practice Files\Books.csv'
CSV HEADER;

-- Customers
COPY customers(Customer_ID, Name, Email, Phone, City, Country)
FROM 'E:\my SQL\ST - SQL ALL PRACTICE FILES\All Excel Practice Files\Customers.csv'
CSV HEADER;

-- Orders
COPY orders(Order_ID, Customer_ID, Book_ID, Order_Date, Quantity, Total_Amount)
FROM 'E:\my SQL\ST - SQL ALL PRACTICE FILES\All Excel Practice Files\Orders.csv'
CSV HEADER;
```

## Data Analysis & Business Insights

### 1. All Fiction Books

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE genre = 'Fiction';
```

### 2. Books Published After 1950

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE Published_Year > 1950;
```

<details>
<summary>üß† Other Methods to Write This Query</summary>

* Using `BETWEEN`:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM books
  WHERE Published_Year BETWEEN 1951 AND 2025;
  ```

* Using `NOT <=`:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM books
  WHERE NOT Published_Year <= 1950;
  ```

* Using CTE:

  ```sql
  WITH recent_books AS (
      SELECT * FROM books WHERE Published_Year > 1950
  )
  SELECT * FROM recent_books;
  ```

* Create a View:

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW recent_books AS
  SELECT * FROM books WHERE Published_Year > 1950;

  SELECT * FROM recent_books;
  ```

</details>

### 3. Customers from Canada

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Canada';
```

Alternative using View:

```sql
CREATE VIEW Canadian_cus AS
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Canada';

SELECT * FROM Canadian_cus;
```

---

### 4. Orders Placed in November 2023

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE Order_Date BETWEEN '2023-11-01' AND '2023-11-30';
```

Alternative using `TO_CHAR()`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE TO_CHAR(Order_Date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2023-11';
```

---

### 5. Total Stock of Books Available

WHERE o.Total_Amount > 20
ORDER BY o.Total_Amount DESC;
```

---

### 9. List of All Book Genres

FROM books b
LEFT JOIN orders o ON b.Book_ID = o.Book_ID
GROUP BY b.Book_ID;
```
